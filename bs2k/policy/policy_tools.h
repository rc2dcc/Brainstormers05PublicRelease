/** The class MachtPositions implements am matching mechanism. 
    It can match up ton num_players_MAX to the maximum of num_targets_MAX 
    of targets. Both players and targets are represented as vectors.

    The matching mechnism does use a heuristic. It doesn't consider all
    possible matchings, but instead every target can just be matched by
    one of the nearest 3 players.

    if num_targets_MAX=6, then ther are
    3^num_targets_MAX= 3^6= 729  possible solutions
    
    You can also use more then 3 nearest neighbours, but the code is optimized
    just for 3, so you will have to change some details (i.e. the computation of
    nearest neighbours for the targets)
